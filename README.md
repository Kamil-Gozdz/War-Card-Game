# War-Card-Game
Description:

Console view game, which logic is similar to popular card game War. The deck of twenty four cards (from Ace to Nine copied  four times) are shuffle and deal to player and the computer. Then both plays a one card to the stack and seniority of cards is compare - player with higher card seniority gets all the stack. In case of tie players puts cards till the moment, that someone has higher card seniority. The game is won by player who collect all the cards from the deck.

Note: In some cases the game couldn't stop - it depends how the cards are shuffle in the deck, but I'm working on it. For now one player is available to choose.
